*Figure 2: Summary of genome-wide association results using MLM, MLMM,
FarmCPU and Blink models on single environment and multi-environment
traits related to days from sowing to flower (DTF) in a lentil diversity
panel. Larger points represent a significant association (-log10(p) \>
6.7) with a trait of interest under one of the GWAS models, while
smaller points represent a suggestive association (-log10(p) \> 5.3).
PC1, PC2, PC3, represent the first three principal components of an
analysis of 18 site-years of DTF data (Wright et al., 2020) in Rosthern,
Canada 2016 and 2017 (Ro16 and Ro17), Sutherland, Canada 2016, 2017 and
2018 (Su16, Su17 and Su18), Central Ferry, USA 2018 (Us18), Bhopal,
India 2016 and 2017 (In16 and In17), Jessore, Bangladesh 2016 and 2017
(Ba16 and Ba17), Bardiya, Nepal 2016 and 2017 (Ne16 and Ne17),
Marchouch, Morocco 2016 and 2017 (Mo16 and Mo17), Cordoba, Spain (Sp16

are coefficients from a photothermal model (Wright et al., 2020) and
used to calculate the nominal base temperature (Tb), nominal base
photoperiod (Pc), thermal sum required for flowering (Tf) and the
photoperiod sum required for flowering (Pf). Colors are representative
of macroenvironments: Temperate (green), South Asian (orange)
Mediterranean (blue) and multi-environment traits (grey). Vertical lines
represent specific base pair locations to facilitate comparisons across
traits.*
